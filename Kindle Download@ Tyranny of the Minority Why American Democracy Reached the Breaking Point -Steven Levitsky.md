**Book Synopsis** : A call to reform our antiquated political institutions before it?s too late?from the New York Times bestselling authors of How Democracies DieAmerica is undergoing a massive experiment: It is moving, in fits and starts, toward a multiracial democracy, something few societies have ever done. But the prospect of change has sparked an authoritarian backlash that threatens the very foundations of our political system. Why is this happening here, and not in other diversifying nations? And what can we do to save our democracy?With the clarity and brilliance that made their first book, How Democracies Die, a global bestseller, Harvard professors Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt offer a coherent framework for understanding these volatile times. They draw on a wealth of examples?from 1930s France to present-day Thailand?to explain why and how political parties turn against democracy: When political leaders realize they can no longer win at the ballot box, they begin to attack the system .

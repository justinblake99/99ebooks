**Book Synopsis** : The tale of a forgotten woman whose journey sparked lasting change for women's rights and exposed injustices that still resonate today.Elizabeth Packard was an ordinary Victorian housewife and mother of six. That was, until the first Woman?s Rights Convention was held in 1848, inspiring Elizabeth and many other women to dream of greater freedoms. She began voicing her opinions on politics and religion ? opinions that her husband did not share. Incensed and deeply threatened by her growing independence, he had her declared 'slightly insane' and committed to an asylum.Inside the Illinois State Hospital, Elizabeth found many other perfectly lucid women who, like her, had been betrayed by their husbands and incarcerated for daring to have a voice. But just because you are sane, doesn?t mean that you can escape a madhouse ?Fighting the stigma of her gender and her supposed madness, Elizabeth embarked on a ceaseless quest for justice. It not only challenged the medical science of the day .

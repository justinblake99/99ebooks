**Book Synopsis** : Is there a new reformation happening in the church? It depends on who you ask. The New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) is a popular and fast-growing new movement of Christians who emphasize signs and wonders, and teach that God is giving new revelation through new apostles and prophets. But is this biblical Christianity? In?Counterfeit Kingdom,?apologists and NAR experts Holly Pivec and Douglas Geivett show how the NAR?s key tenets distort the?gospel,?twist the Scriptures, are influenced by New Age practices, and?lead faithful Christians to shipwreck their faith. They also offer practical suggestions for readers who are already influenced by the NAR, curious about it, or concerned about loved ones who have been swept up in the movement. What used to be on the fringes of the church is now mainstream,?and many are being influenced by it unaware. This book is a wake-up call. .
